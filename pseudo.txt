1	Create a node containing the goal state node_goal
2	Create a node containing the start state node_start
3	Put node_start on the open list
4	while the OPEN list is not empty
5	{
6	Get the node off the open list with the lowest f and call it node_current
7	if node_current is the same state as node_goal we have found the solution; break from the while loop
8	    Generate each state node_successor that can come after node_current
9	    for each node_successor of node_current
10	    {
11	        Set the cost of node_successor to be the cost of node_current plus the cost to get to node_successor from node_current
12	        find node_successor on the OPEN list
13	        if node_successor is on the OPEN list but the existing one is as good or better then discard this successor and continue
14	        if node_successor is on the CLOSED list but the existing one is as good or better then discard this successor and continue
15	        Remove occurences of node_successor from OPEN and CLOSED
16	        Set the parent of node_successor to node_current
17	        Set h to be the estimated distance to node_goal (Using the heuristic function)
18	         Add node_successor to the OPEN list
19	    }
20	    Add node_current to the CLOSED list
21	}
